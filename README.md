# Valve-Anti-Cheat
Includes various projects that I coded to reverse the famous anti cheat of Valve.
The analysis were done on the game Counter Strike: Global Offensive, but procedure is pretty much same for any VAC game.

# Vac Emulator:
Contains code that can call any VAC modules that was previously reversed.
This emulates correct Ice Key encryption required to run a VAC module.
Most of the work (really, a lot) is put into definitions of modules, as they were all reverse engineered with IDA.
